      <p class="body-p">This site pulls data from Reddit based off the entered search terms and extracts mentioned restaurants, sentiment, and computes a popularity score based on comment age and upvotes. See <a href="/workings">How It Works</a> for more information.</p>
      
    <h1 class="body-h">Usage</h1><p class="body-p">On average, computed relevancy scores are generally ~88% accurate, and ~ 70-90% of restaurants mentioned in a post are captured. </p><p class="body-p">Restaurant data (full name, address, business status) is populated for the top results independently from a third-party API, after ranking data has been collected.</p><p class="body-p">Generally, popularity scores should be interpreted relative to other results. Depending on the popularity of a type of food and location, different amounts of total data may be collected, meaning less chance for a given restaurant to accrue points. Typically, a restaurant with &lt;10 points has insufficient data to properly rank it: It could be a meaningful mention, or just random probability.</p><p class="body-p">Because restaurants may be expressed in a variety of ways (abbreviations, in-part, or in-whole) restaurant names are normalized and similiar ones are grouped together. This process is not perfect, and the individual restaurants that were grouped are displayed under each listing ("AKA:"). For restaurants with generic words in their name (eg, "Ramen") this may result in several unrelated restaurants being grouped together. When this is the case, the listing should be ignored; however, if there is only one or two stray restaurants, the listing is generally still accurate.</p><p class="body-p">Extracting and processing hundreds of comments/query is a heavy task that runs on GPUs in a cloud. As a result, listings may take a while to initially show up - this is normal.</p><h1 class="body-h">Intention</h1><p class="body-p">Towards the end of December 2021, I was looking for good restaurant recommendations in Los Angeles. Sure, you have TripAdvisor, Yelp, and dozens of other Top-X lists, but for those most part, those are rarely accurate and the difference between 4.7 stars and 4.5 stars is usually negligible.</p><p class="body-p">I stumbled upon r/FoodLosAngeles and their recommdations were 4-for-4 during my brief stay. I'm not a food critic, but I fanthom most people aren't either and just want to eat <i>something good.</i></p><p class="body-p">So, I embarked a project that ultimately led to this site: to mine restaurant recommendations from Reddit. I hope this site is helpful to you, as it's certainly be quite helpful for me.</p><p class="body-p">Built by Welton Wang Â© 2021</p></div>
